# BETES installation procedure
## Getting started
Several scripts and documents are provided to learn to work with BETES. In folder _src_ we find the `Ekman_model.m` archive which is the main code of BETES. 
On the other hand `adjustpdfpage.m` and `profile_Kz.m` are functions to print the plots in pdf and provide, for the main code, the eddy turbulent viscosity, respectively.
The archive `datos_GoC_medios.mat` contains experimental results taken form Mazag√≥n (Huelva, Spain).

In folder _doc_ we find a pdf to describe roughly the numerical scheme used for BETES.
## Programming language and installation
BETES is written in MATLAB (R2020b).
